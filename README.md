I've been impressed with the Node.js framework [Loopback](http://loopback.io/), including their great docs with this [tutorial project to create a basic Yelp clone](https://docs.strongloop.com/display/public/LB/Introducing+the+Coffee+Shop+Reviews+app). But the result of the tutorial looks very plain and could use a number of improvements. Here's a screenshot of the original styling:

This repo gives the Loopback tutorial a "facelift" by restyling with the [Material Design Lite (MDL)](https://www.getmdl.io/) library. MDL is a nifty CSS library that offers a very simple and effective implementation of [Google's Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html), allowing a beginner to quickly style a site according to Material Design standards.

Here's a screenshot of the improved styling with Material Design Lite
